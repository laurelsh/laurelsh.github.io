abstract = {{Many asexually-propagating marine invertebrates can survive extreme environmental conditions by developing dormant structures, i.e., morphologically simplified bodies that retain the capacity to completely regenerate a functional adult when conditions return to normal. Here, we examine the environmental, morphological, and molecular characteristics of dormancy in two distantly related clonal tunicate species: Polyandrocarpa zorritensis and Clavelina lepadiformis. In both species, we report that the dormant structures are able to withstand harsher temperature and salinity conditions compared to the adults. The dormant structures are the dominant forms these species employ to survive adverse conditions when the zooids themselves cannot survive. While previous work shows C. lepadiformis dormant stage is present in winters in the Atlantic Ocean and summers in the Mediterranean, this study is the first to show a year-round presence of P. zorritensis dormant forms in NW Italy, even in the late winter when all zooids have disappeared. By finely controlling the entry and exit of dormancy in laboratory-reared individuals, we were able to select and characterize the morphology of dormant structures associated with their transcriptome dynamics. In both species, we identified putative stem and nutritive cells in structures that resemble the earliest stages of asexual propagation. By characterizing gene expression during dormancy and regeneration into the adult body plan (i.e., germination), we observed that genes which control dormancy and environmental sensing in other metazoans, notably HIF-α and insulin signaling genes, are also expressed in tunicate dormancy. Germination-related genes in these two species, such as the retinoic acid pathway, are also found in other unrelated clonal tunicates during asexual development. These results are suggestive of repeated co-option of conserved eco-physiological and regeneration programs for the origin of novel dormancy-germination processes across distantly related animal taxa.}},

abstract = {{Botryllid ascidians are a group of marine invertebrate chordates that are colonial and grow by repeated rounds of asexual reproduction to form a colony of individual bodies, called zooids, linked by a common vascular network. Two distinct processes are responsible for zooid regeneration. In the first, called blastogenesis, new zooids arise from a region of multipotent epithelium from a pre-existing zooid. In the second, called whole body regeneration (WBR), mobile cells in the vasculature coalesce and are the source of the new zooid. In some botryllid species, blastogenesis and WBR occur concurrently, while in others, blastogenesis is used exclusively for growth, while WBR only occurs following injury or exiting periods of dormancy. In species such as Botrylloides diegensis, injury induced WBR is triggered by the surgical isolation of a small piece of vasculature. However, Botryllus schlosseri has unique requirements that must be met for successful injury induced WBR. Our goal was to understand why there would be different requirements between these two species. While WBR in B. diegensis was robust, we found that in B. schlosseri, new zooid growth following injury is unlikely due to circulatory cells, but instead a result of ectopic development of tissues leftover from the blastogenic process. These tissues could be whole, damaged, or partially resorbed developing zooids, and we defined the minimal amount of vascular biomass to support ectopic regeneration. We did find a common theme between the two species: a competitive process exists which results in only a single zooid reaching maturity following injury. We utilized this phenomenon and found that competition is reversible and mediated by circulating factors and/or cells. We propose that WBR does not occur in B. schlosseri and that the unique requirements defined in other studies only serve to increase the chances of ectopic development. This is likely a response to injury as we have discovered a vascular-based reversible competitive mechanism which ensures that only a single zooid completes development. This competition has been described in other species, but the unique response of B. schlosseri to injury provides a new model to study resource allocation and competition within an individual.}},

Drosophila neuroblasts sequentially express the transcription factors Hunchback (Hb), Krüppel (Kr), Pdm1/Pdm2 (Pdm) and Castor (Cas). Hb is necessary and sufficient to specify early-born temporal identity and, thus, Hb downregulation is essential for specification of later-born progeny. Here, we show that distal antenna (dan) and distal antenna-related (danr), encoding pipsqueak motif DNA-binding domain protein family members, are detected in all neuroblasts during the Hb-to-Cas expression window. Dan and Danr are required for timely downregulation of Hb in neuroblasts and for limiting the number of early-born neurons. Dan and Danr function independently of Seven-up (Svp), an orphan nuclear receptor known to repress Hb expression in neuroblasts, because Dan, Danr and Svp do not regulate each other and dan danr svp triple mutants have increased early-born neurons compared with either dan danr or svp mutants. Interestingly, misexpression of Hb can induce Dan and Svp expression in neuroblasts, suggesting that Hb might activate a negative feedback loop to limit its own expression. We conclude that Dan/Danr and Svp act in parallel pathways to limit Hb expression and allow neuroblasts to transition from making early-born neurons to late-born neurons at the proper time.}},
