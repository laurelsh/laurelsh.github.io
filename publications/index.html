Here, we examine the environmental, morphological, and molecular characteristics of dormancy in two distantly related clonal tunicate species: Polyandrocarpa zorritensis and Clavelina lepadiformis. In both species, we report that the dormant structures are able to withstand harsher temperature and salinity conditions compared to the adults. The dormant structures are the dominant forms these species employ to survive adverse conditions when the zooids themselves cannot survive. While previous work shows C. lepadiformis dormant stage is present in winters in the Atlantic Ocean and summers in the Mediterranean, this study is the first to show a year-round presence of P. zorritensis dormant forms in NW Italy, even in the late winter when all zooids have disappeared. By finely controlling the entry and exit of dormancy in laboratory-reared individuals, we were able to select and characterize the morphology of dormant structures associated with their transcriptome dynamics. In both species, we identified putative stem and nutritive cells in structures that resemble the earliest stages of asexual propagation. By characterizing gene expression during dormancy and regeneration into the adult body plan (i.e., germination), we observed that genes which control dormancy and environmental sensing in other metazoans, notably HIF-α and insulin signaling genes, are also expressed in tunicate dormancy. Germination-related genes in these two species, such as the retinoic acid pathway, are also found in other unrelated clonal tunicates during asexual development. These results are suggestive of repeated co-option of conserved eco-physiological and regeneration programs for the origin of novel dormancy-germination processes across distantly related animal taxa.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2021-F-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2021-F-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2021-F-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2021-F.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2021-F.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="10.1002/jez.b.23044" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">From the individual to the colony: Marine invertebrates as models to understand levels of biological organization</div> <div class="author"> <em>Laurel S.

Although many common traits have evolved independently in different groups of colonial animals, questions about their significance for colonial life histories remain unanswered. In 2018 (Nov. 25 - Dec. 8), the inaugural course on the Evolution of Coloniality and Modularity took place at the Center for Marine Biology of the University of São Paulo (CEBIMAR-USP), Brazil. During the intensive two-week graduate-level course, we addressed some of the historical ideas about animal coloniality by focal studies in bryozoans, tunicates, cnidarians, and sponges. We discussed many historical hypotheses and ways to test these using both extant and paleontological data, and we carried direct observations of animal colonies in the different phyla to address questions about coloniality. We covered topics related to multi-level selection theory and studied colonial traits, including modular miniaturization, polymorphism, brooding, and allorecognition. Course participants carried out short research projects using local species of animals to address questions on allorecognition and regeneration in ascidians and sponges, fusion and chimerism in anthoathecate hydrozoans, and evolution of polymorphism in bryozoans. Although many questions remain unanswered, this course served as a foundation to continue to develop a developmental and evolutionary synthesis of clonal and modular development in colonial marine organisms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2021-W-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2021-W-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2021-W-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2021-W.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2021-W.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="10.1186/s13227-021-00185-y" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Whole body regeneration and developmental competition in two botryllid ascidians</div> <div class="author"> Shane Nourizadeh, Susannah Kassmer, Delany Rodriguez, <em>Laurel S.

Two distinct processes are responsible for zooid regeneration. In the first, called blastogenesis, new zooids arise from a region of multipotent epithelium from a pre-existing zooid. In the second, called whole body regeneration (WBR), mobile cells in the vasculature coalesce and are the source of the new zooid. In some botryllid species, blastogenesis and WBR occur concurrently, while in others, blastogenesis is used exclusively for growth, while WBR only occurs following injury or exiting periods of dormancy. In species such as Botrylloides diegensis, injury induced WBR is triggered by the surgical isolation of a small piece of vasculature. However, Botryllus schlosseri has unique requirements that must be met for successful injury induced WBR. Our goal was to understand why there would be different requirements between these two species. While WBR in B. diegensis was robust, we found that in B. schlosseri, new zooid growth following injury is unlikely due to circulatory cells, but instead a result of ectopic development of tissues leftover from the blastogenic process. These tissues could be whole, damaged, or partially resorbed developing zooids, and we defined the minimal amount of vascular biomass to support ectopic regeneration. We did find a common theme between the two species: a competitive process exists which results in only a single zooid reaching maturity following injury. We utilized this phenomenon and found that competition is reversible and mediated by circulating factors and/or cells. We propose that WBR does not occur in B. schlosseri and that the unique requirements defined in other studies only serve to increase the chances of ectopic development. This is likely a response to injury as we have discovered a vascular-based reversible competitive mechanism which ensures that only a single zooid completes development. This competition has been described in other species, but the unique response of B. schlosseri to injury provides a new model to study resource allocation and competition within an individual.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2020-C-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2020-C-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2020-C-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2020-C.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2020-C.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="10.1002/jez.b.22944" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Coloniality, clonality, and modularity in animals: The elephant in the room</div> <div class="author"> <em>Laurel S.

Clonal reproduction, colony formation, and modular organization have important consequences for many aspects of organismal biology. Theories in ecology, evolution, and development are often based on unitary and, mainly, strictly sexually reproducing organisms, and though colonial animals dominate many marine ecosystems and habitats, recognized concepts for the study of clonal species are often lacking. In this review, we present an overview of the study of colonial and clonal animals, from the historic interests in this subject to modern research in a range of topics, including immunology, stem cell biology, aging, biogeography, and ecology. We attempt to portray the fundamental questions lying behind the biology of colonial animals, focusing on how colonial animals challenge several dogmas in biology as well as the remaining puzzles still to be answered, of which there are many.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2020-T-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2020-T-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2020-T-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2020-T.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2020-T.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Alie:2020ey" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The eventful history of nonembryonic development in tunicates</div> <div class="author"> Alexandre Alié, <em>Laurel S.

The phylogeny of tunicates suggests that asexual reproduction is an evolutionarily plastic trait, a view that is further reinforced by the fact that budding mechanisms differ from one species to another, involving nonhomologous tissues and cells. In this review, we explore more than 150 years of literature to provide an overview of NED diversity and we present a comparative picture of budding tissues across tunicates. Based on the phylogenetic relationships between budding and nonbudding species, we hypothesize that NED diversity is the result of seven independent acquisitions and subsequent diversifications in the course of tunicate evolution. While this scenario represents the state-of-the-art of our current knowledge, we point out gray areas that need to be further explored to refine our understanding of tunicate phylogeny and NED. Tunicates, with their plastic evolution and diversity of budding, represent an ideal playground for evolutionary developmental biologists to unravel the genetic and molecular mechanisms regulating nonembryonic development, as well as to better understand how such a profound innovation in life-history has evolved in numerous metazoans.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-C-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-C-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-C-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-C.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2019-C.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Hiebert:2019dja" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Colonial ascidians strongly preyed upon, yet dominate the substrate in a subtropical fouling community</div> <div class="author"> <em>Laurel S.

We verified this pattern in species richness of ascidians, finding that higher colonial-to-solitary species ratios occur in the tropics and subtropics. At the latitudinal region with the highest ratio, in southeastern Brazil, we confirmed that colonial species dominate space on artificial plates in two independent studies of five fouling communities. We manipulated settlement plates to measure effects of predation and competition on growth and survivorship of colonial versus solitary ascidians. Eight species were subjected to a predation treatment, i.e. caged versus exposed to predators, and a competition treatment, i.e. leaving versus removing competitors, to assess main and interactive effects. Predation had a greater effect on growth and survivorship of colonial compared to solitary species, whereas competition did not show consistent patterns. We hypothesize that colonial ascidians dominate at this subtropical site despite being highly preyed upon because they regrow when partially consumed and can adjust in shape and space to grow into refuges. We contend that these means of avoiding mortality from predation can have large influences on diversification patterns of colonial species at low latitudes, where predation intensity is greater.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-N-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-N-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-N-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-N.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2019-N.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Scelzo:2019ei" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Novel budding mode in Polyandrocarpa zorritensis: a model for comparative studies on asexual development and whole body regeneration</div> <div class="author"> Marta Scelzo, Alexandre Alié, Sophie Pagnotta, Camille Lejeune, Pauline Henry, Laurent Gilletta, <em>Laurel S.

A recent phylogeny of the family Styelidae revealed an independent acquisition of NED in the colonial species Polyandrocarpa zorritensis and highlighted a novel budding mode. In this paper, we provide the first detailed characterization of the asexual life cycle of P. zorritensis. Results: Bud formation occurs along a tubular protrusion of the adult epidermis, the stolon, in a vascularized area defined as budding nest. The bud arises through a folding of the epithelia of the stolon with the contribution of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. This previously unreported mode of bud onset leads to the formation of a double vesicle, which starts to develop into a zooid through morphogenetic mechanisms common to other Styelidae. The budding nest can also continue to accumulate nutrients and develop into a round-shaped structure, designated as spherule, which represents a dormant form able to survive low temperatures. Conclusions: To understand the mechanisms of NED and their evolution, it is fundamental to start from a robust phylogenetic framework in order to select relevant species to compare. The anatomical description of P. zorritensis NED provides the foundation for future comparative studies on plasticity of budding and regeneration in tunicates.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-P-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-P-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-P-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2019-P.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2019-P.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="JimenezMerino:2019kl" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Putative stem cells in the hemolymph and in the intestinal submucosa of the solitary ascidian Styela plicata</div> <div class="author"> Juan Jiménez-Merino, Isadora Santos de Abreu, <em>Laurel S.

Results: Using flow cytometry, we characterized a population of circulating putative stem cells (CPSCs) in S. plicata and determined two gates likely enriched with CPSCs based on morphology and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. We found an ALDH + cell population with low granularity, suggesting a stem-like state. In an attempt to uncover putative CPSCs niches in S. plicata, we performed a histological survey for hemoblast-like cells, followed by immunohistochemistry with stem cell and proliferation markers. The intestinal submucosa (IS) showed high cellular proliferation levels and high frequency of undifferentiated cells and histological and ultrastructural analyses revealed the presence of hemoblast aggregations in the IS suggesting a possible niche. Finally, we document the first ontogenetic appearance of distinct metamorphic circulatory mesenchyme cells, which precedes the emergence of juvenile hemocytes. Conclusions: We find CPSCs in the hemolymph of the solitary ascidian Styela plicata, presumably involved in the regenerative capacity of this species. The presence of proliferating and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells suggests IS as a possible niche.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2018-C-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2018-C-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2018-C-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2018-C.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2018-C.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="10.1093/molbev/msy068" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Convergent Acquisition of Nonembryonic Development in Styelid Ascidians</div> <div class="author"> Alexandre Alié, <em>Laurel S.

Whereas it is challenging to reconstruct the gains or losses of NED at large phylogenetic scale, comparative studies could benefit from being conducted at more restricted taxonomic scale, in groups for which phylogenetic relationships are well established. The ascidian family of Styelidae encompasses strictly sexually reproducing solitary forms as well as colonial species that combine sexual reproduction with different forms of NED. To date, the phylogenetic relationships between colonial and solitary styelids remain controversial and so is the pattern of NED evolution. In this study, we built an original pipeline to combine eight genomes with 18 de novo assembled transcriptomes and constructed data sets of unambiguously orthologous genes. Using a phylogenomic super-matrix of 4,908 genes from these 26 tunicates we provided a robust phylogeny of this family of chordates, which supports two convergent acquisitions of NED. This result prompted us to further describe the budding process in the species Polyandrocarpa zorritensis, leading to the discovery of a novel mechanism of asexual development. Whereas the pipeline and the data sets produced can be used for further phylogenetic reconstructions in tunicates, the phylogeny provided here sets an evolutionary framework for future experimental studies on the emergence and disappearance of complex characters such as asexual propagation and whole body regeneration.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2016-S-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2016-S-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2016-S-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2016-S.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2016-S.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Billings:2016ie" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">SyPRID sampler: A large-volume, high-resolution, autonomous, deep-ocean precision plankton sampling system</div> <div class="author"> Andrew Billings, Carl Kaiser, Craig M Young, <em>Laurel S.

The SyPRID (Sentry Precision Robotic Impeller Driven) sampler is an innovative, deep-rated (6000 m) plankton sampler that partners with the Sentry Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to obtain paired, large-volume plankton samples at specified depths and survey lines to within 1.5 m of the seabed and with simultaneous collection of sensor data. SyPRID uses a perforated Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight (UHMW) plastic tube to support a fine mesh net within an outer carbon composite tube (tube-within-a-tube design), with an axial flow pump located aft of the capture filter. The pump facilitates flow through the system and reduces or possibly eliminates the bow wave at the mouth opening. The cod end, a hollow truncated cone, is also made of UHMW plastic and includes a collection volume designed to provide an area where zooplankton can collect, out of the high flow region. SyPRID attaches as a saddle-pack to the Sentry vehicle. Sentry itself is configured with a flight control system that enables autonomous survey paths to low altitudes. In its verification deployment at the Blake Ridge Seep (2160 m) on the US Atlantic Margin, SyPRID was operated for 6 h at an altitude of 5 m. It recovered plankton samples, including delicate living larvae, from the near-bottom stratum that is seldom sampled by a typical MOCNESS tow. The prototype SyPRID and its next generations will enable studies of plankton or other particulate distributions associated with localized physico-chemical strata in the water column or above patchy habitats on the seafloor.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-E-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-E-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-E-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-E.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2015-E.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Hiebert:2015cg" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Expression of Hox, Cdx, and Six3/6 genes in the hoplonemertean Pantinonemertes californiensis offers insight into the evolution of maximally indirect development in the phylum Nemertea</div> <div class="author"> <em>Laurel S.

All other nemerteans have more or less direct development. The origin of pilidial development with disjunct invaginated juvenile rudiments and catastrophic metamorphosis remains poorly understood. While basal members of the phylum, the Palaeonemertea, do not appear to have ever had a pilidium, certain similarity exists in the development of the Pilidiophora and the sister clade, the Hoplonemertea. It is unclear whether this similarity represents the homology and whether pilidial development evolved before or after pilidiophorans diverged from hoplonemerteans. To gain insight into these questions, we examined the expression of Hox, Cdx, and Six3/6 genes in the development of the hoplonemertean Pantinonemertes californiensis and expression of Six3/6 in the pilidium of Micrura alaskensis. To further characterize the function of larval structures showing expression of these genes, we examined the serotonergic nervous system and cell proliferation in P. californiensis. Results: We show that Hox and Cdx genes, which pattern the pilidial imaginal discs giving rise to the juvenile trunk, are expressed in paired posterior epidermal invaginations in P. californiensis larvae. We also show that Six3/6 patterns both the pilidial cephalic discs, which give rise to the juvenile head, and a pair of anterior epidermal invaginations in hoplonemertean development. We show that anterior invaginations in larval P. californiensis are associated with a pair of serotonergic neurons, and thus may have a role in the development of the juvenile nervous system. This is similar to the role of cephalic discs in pilidiophoran development. Finally, we show that four zones of high cell proliferation correspond to the paired invaginations in P. californiensis, suggesting that these invaginations may play a similar role in the development of the hoplonemertean juvenile to the role of imaginal discs in the pilidium, which also exhibit high rates of cell proliferation. Conclusions: Expression of Hox, Cdx, and Six3/6 genes supports the homology between the imaginal discs of the pilidium and the paired larval invaginations in hoplonemerteans. This suggests that invaginated juvenile rudiments (possible precursors to pilidial imaginal discs) may have been present in the most recent common ancestor of the Pilidiophora and Hoplonemertea.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-H-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-H-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-H-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-H.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2015-H.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Hiebert:2015ev" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Hox genes pattern the anterior-posterior axis of the juvenile but not the larva in a maximally indirect developing invertebrate, Micrura alaskensis (Nemertea)</div> <div class="author"> <em>Laurel S.

While the sister clade of the Pilidiophora and the basal nemerteans develop directly, pilidiophorans have a long-lived planktotrophic larva with a body plan distinctly different from that of the juvenile. Uniquely, the pilidiophoran juvenile develops inside the larva from several discrete rudiments. The orientation of the juvenile with respect to the larval body varies within the Pilidiophora, which suggests that the larval and juvenile anteroposterior (AP) axes are patterned differently. In order to gain insight into the evolutionary origins of the pilidium larva and the mechanisms underlying this implied axial uncoupling, we examined the expression of the Hox genes during development of the pilidiophoran Micrura alaskensis. Results: We identified sequences of nine Hox genes and the ParaHox gene caudal through a combination of transcriptome analysis and molecular cloning, and determined their expression pattern during development using in situ hybridization in whole-mounted larvae. We found that Hox genes are first expressed long after the pilidium is fully formed and functional. The Hox genes are expressed in apparently overlapping domains along the AP axis of the developing juvenile in a subset of the rudiments that give rise to the juvenile trunk. Hox genes are not expressed in the larval body at any stage of development. Conclusions: While the Hox genes pattern the juvenile pilidiophoran, the pilidial body, which appears to be an evolutionary novelty, must be patterned by some mechanism other than the Hox genes. Although the pilidiophoran juvenile develops from separate rudiments with no obvious relationship to the embryonic formation of the larva, the Hox genes appear to exhibit canonical expression along the juvenile AP axis. This suggests that the Hox patterning system can maintain conserved function even when widely decoupled from early polarity established in the egg.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-N-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-N-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-N-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2015-N.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2015-N.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Trowbridge:2015hs" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Nemerteans in an Irish marine reserve: synopsis of current and historical records</div> <div class="author"> Cynthia D.

From 2004 to 2014, common nemerteans were recorded annually in late summer for ten historical monitoring sites (each 10 m of shoreline); more comprehensive surveys were completed in 2012 (4126 low-intertidal to shallow-subtidal rocks were turned) and 2014 (1289 rocks turned) with supplementary information in 2015. The bootlace worm, Lineus longissimus, was the most abundant nemertean species. It was significantly more abundant at the extremely shallow East Castle site than the other nine sites; peak populations (across all ten sites) occurred in 2012. The Lusitanian nemertean Paradrepanophorus crassus was abundant after 2007. To date, 13 nemertean species were recorded with numerous new records for the lough, including Tubulanus annulatus, Micrura purpurea, Ramphogordius sanguineus, Micrella rufa and Emplectonema gracile. Three additional nemertean species were previously recorded, indicating that at least 16 species occur in the lough.

But one type, called pilidium recurvatum, looks more like a sock, swimming heel first. This distinctive larva was discovered in 1883 off the coast of Rhode Island and subsequently found in plankton samples from other parts of the world. Despite the long time since discovery, and its significance in discussions of larval evolution, this larva remained unidentified even to the family level. We collected pilidium recurvatum larvae from plankton samples in Coos Bay, OR, and identified them as belonging to the heteronemertean genus Riserius based on juvenile morphology and DNA sequence data. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that two distinct types of pilidium recurvatum from Oregon represent two new species within this currently monotypic genus. We describe the morphology of pilidium recurvatum using confocal microscopy and compare it to that of the typical pilidium, discussing possible implications for larval feeding. We also report our surprising discovery that juveniles of Riserius sp. from Oregon prey on another nemertean, Carcinonemertes errans, an egg predator of Cancer magister (Dungeness crab), a commercially important species.

Drosophila neuroblasts sequentially express the transcription factors Hunchback (Hb), Krüppel (Kr), Pdm1/Pdm2 (Pdm) and Castor (Cas). Hb is necessary and sufficient to specify early-born temporal identity and, thus, Hb downregulation is essential for specification of later-born progeny. Here, we show that distal antenna (dan) and distal antenna-related (danr), encoding pipsqueak motif DNA-binding domain protein family members, are detected in all neuroblasts during the Hb-to-Cas expression window. Dan and Danr are required for timely downregulation of Hb in neuroblasts and for limiting the number of early-born neurons. Dan and Danr function independently of Seven-up (Svp), an orphan nuclear receptor known to repress Hb expression in neuroblasts, because Dan, Danr and Svp do not regulate each other and dan danr svp triple mutants have increased early-born neurons compared with either dan danr or svp mutants. Interestingly, misexpression of Hb can induce Dan and Svp expression in neuroblasts, suggesting that Hb might activate a negative feedback loop to limit its own expression. We conclude that Dan/Danr and Svp act in parallel pathways to limit Hb expression and allow neuroblasts to transition from making early-born neurons to late-born neurons at the proper time.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2010</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/2010-F-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2010-F-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/2010-F-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2010-F.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2010-F.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="10.1080/00222933.2010.504893" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Five invaginations and shedding of the larval epidermis during development of the hoplonemertean Pantinonemertes californiensis(Nemertea: Hoplonemertea)</div> <div class="author"> <em>Laurel S.

Well-known examples of such complex life cycles of terrestrial animals include butterflies and frogs. Many people are unaware, however, that complex life cycles are exceedingly prevalent in marine environments. Marine invertebrates, such as sea urchins, sea stars, and crabs, all have a microscopic pelagic larval stage that looks nothing at all like the familiar adult form. The authors have developed a lesson to teach students about complex life cycles using crab larvae and adult crabs. This lesson allows 3rd- to 6th-grade students to compare and contrast body plans while learning about adaptations the larvae and adults have made to their respective habitats. Throughout the lesson, students practice skills important for scientific inquiry: making observations, drawing what they see, asking and answering questions, and learning to use scientific tools such as microscopes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Laurel Sky Hiebert.
